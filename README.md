# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview

  The purpose of this was to help Pewlett-Hackard forecast how many employees were up to retire as well as how many positions will need to be filled in their absence. Creating a code to help combine multiple CSV files that were unrelated into files that can help answer questions the business needs to know. I was given 6 files containing varying data about their staff.
  
## Results 

 - There are 41,380 total employees getting prepare foe retirement with the company.
 - The biggest group of employees leaving the company soon due to retirement were the Senior Engineers with 29,414 total employees. A lot of spots to back fill!
 - There are 1,940 employees who are eligible for the mentorship program. 
 - The title with the least number of employees retiring is the "Manager" position. 

## Summary 

  
  In conclusion PH has many spots to fill with new talent especially the Senior Software Engineer roles. They may either look to promote current software engineers or hire from outside. This will help the HR department understand where their biggest gaps will be moving forward.
